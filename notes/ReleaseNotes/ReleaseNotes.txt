================================================================================
JAVA BUILT USING:
Eclipse IDE: 2019-09 R (4.13.0)
Compiler compilance level: 1.8
JRE(Java Runtime Environment): 11.

GML BUILT USING:
IDE v2.2.5.481		- RUNTIME v2.2.5.378 
IDE v2022.3.0.625	- RUNTIME v2022.3.0.497

Always check BNET_NETWORKMANAGER create evet for new variables added for edit.

Although a simple congestion avoidence algorithym is in place use data functions
sparingly. Basically send data only when needed especially with udp protocol.

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

Gml
	-Lockstep
		~Alpha phase.
		~Values should remain constant when starting lockstep.
		~Does not account for game fps, does not use delta timing.
		~Must recreate instances if wish to start another session.
		~No prediction or rollback.

Java
	-Cli(Command Line Interface)
		~Alpha phase.
================================================================================
KNOWN BUGS / ISSUE:

Gml
	-Server
		
	-Client
		~Rapidly switching rooms along with other function(Stress test) results in mis match room. This does not reflect the server or client, but rather incomplete demo conditional checks. 
		
	-Voip
		~Audio buffer errors
			~Poor quality(Not to invested in this feature sadly).
			~Cut-outs during stream.
		
Java
	-Server
		
	-MongoDb
		~Will throw an exception if any defualt key is missing.

GMS CHANGES
	-Added additional helper functions for eaiser development. DO NOT DELETE.
	-Revamped call-back system. Check out Call-Backs within note section for further information.
		~Most call-backs now returns a ds_map named 'bnet_callback_load' much like 'async_load' that stores READ ONLY data pertaining to the call-back.
	-Revamped buffer send functions, listed under NET. Must now create a script named 'bnetOnMessage()' that takes in 1 argument 'bufferid', to process received buffer.
	-Added onError call-back. Check out Error-Codes within notes section.
	-Added MongoDB functions. Check out MongoDb within note section.
	-Added Event functions.
	-Removed manadatory login to java server.
	-Removed BNET auto destroy if client server doesnt match.
	-Revamped connection handling.
		~Client now auto detects which protocol to use. 'Server still has to specify protocol type: network_socket_tcp, network_socket_ws'.
		~Must now provide a uuid.
		~All connection, and disconnection to the server are now automatically transmitted to all clients.
		~Must now set an alarm within 'bnet_server_destroy()' to notify clients that the server has initiated to be shut downed.
	-Revamped room functions.
		~bnet_room_create(), bnet_room_search(), bnet_room_leave(), bnet_room_destroy(), are all now combined into 'bnet_room_goto()'.
		~bnet_room_set_settings() renamed to bnet_room_update().
		~Can now create empty rooms.
		~Can now leave a room empty.
		~bnet_room_invite(), bnet_room_accept_invite() DEPRECATED.
	-Revamped instance functions.
		~Added barebone lockstep mechanics(ALPHA PHASE).
		~No longer need to add bnet_instance_init() within user-event0 to create on demand.
		~Can now provide room_id to create, update, and dedstroy an instance within a different room.
		~Must now provide a uuid for instances.
		~'bnet_instance_create_depth()', and 'bnet_instance_create_layer()' now returns a gml 'instanceid'.
		~Can now set to only sync when tick-rate is greater than 0 'bnet_instance_update_player()', and 'bnet_instance_update_npc()'.
		~Can now set a tolerance for individual sync variables.
		~Added helper function to assign init-vars. 'bnet_instance_init_data()'.
		~Added helper function to assign sync-vars. 'bnet_instance_sync_data()'.
		~Added 'bnet_instance_update_apply()' used to manually apply update to an instance.

JAVA CHANGES
