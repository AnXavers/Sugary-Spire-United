Error codes are sent when an exception has occurred. You can check for an error with the callback 'bnet_callbacks.onError'. 
Youl use 'bnet_callback_load[? "error"]' to get the code. Like so.

//Since there can be multiple call-backs per step lets loop through them.
while(bnet_data_start){

	//Iterate through them.
	switch(bnet_callback){
		case bnet_callbacks.onError:
			show_debug_message("Error: "+bnet_callback_load[? "error"]+" occurred");
		break;
	}
	
	//Clean up the callback data.
	bnet_data_end;
}
